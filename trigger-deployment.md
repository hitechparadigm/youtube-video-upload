# Deployment Trigger

This file triggers the CI/CD pipeline to deploy v5.1.3 hotfix after CloudFormation stack recovery.

**Stack Status**: UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE âœ…
**Target Version**: v5.1.3 with optimized delays
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-20T19:58:00Z

## Expected Changes
- Scene 2 delay: 2s (reduced from 4s)
- Scene 3 delay: 4s (reduced from 10s)
- Scene 4+ delay: 6s (reduced from 15s)
- Google Places timeout: 15s protection
- Retry attempts: 2 (reduced from 3)

This should resolve the Lambda timeout issues while maintaining the Scene 3 fix.
