## 🎯 **Testing Strategy**

### **Development Testing**
```bash
# Test enhanced architecture (recommended first)
node test-manifest-builder-architecture.js

# Test complete pipeline
node test-complete-pipeline.js

# Test all agents individually
node test-all-agents.js
```

### **Production Validation**
```bash
# Test YouTube Publisher (requires OAuth setup)
node test-youtube-publisher-complete.js

# Validate complete system
node test-complete-pipeline.js
```

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Enhanced Architecture**: `test-manifest-builder-architecture.js` validates quality gatekeeper
- **End-to-End**: `test-complete-pipeline.js` validates full workflow
- **Component Testing**: `test-all-agents.js` validates individual functions
