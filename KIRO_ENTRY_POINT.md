## 🚨 **CURRENT ISSUES & NEXT STEPS**

### **⚠️ IMMEDIATE ISSUES TO RESOLVE**

1. **Media Curator API Failing** ❌
   - **Issue**: `POST /media/search` returns "Internal server error"
   - **Status**: Needs CloudWatch log investigation
   - **Impact**: Prevents media curation testing

2. **Limited API Gateway Endpoints** ⚠️
   - **Available**: `/topics`, `/workflow/start`, `/media/search`
   - **Missing**: Direct endpoints for Script Generator, Audio Generator, Video Assembler, YouTube Publisher
   - **Impact**: Can only test via workflow orchestrator

3. **Jest Test Configuration** ⚠️
   - **Issue**: ES module configuration issues preventing Jest tests from running
   - **Status**: Tests created but failing due to import/export syntax
   - **Impact**: No automated test validation

### **✅ RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS**

1. **Major Codebase Cleanup Completed**
   - Eliminated redundant test directories (`test/`, `scripts/tests/`)
   - Created shared utilities for all Lambda functions
   - Updated all documentation to reflect current state
   - Fixed GitHub Actions workflows

2. **Shared Utilities Implementation**
   - `context-manager.js`: Centralized context validation and storage
   - `aws-service-manager.js`: Unified AWS service utilities
   - `error-handler.js`: Consistent error handling and retry logic
   - All 6 Lambda functions refactored to use shared utilities

3. **Modern Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created proper end-to-end test using API Gateway endpoints
   - Eliminated confusing "legacy" test references
   - Topic Management API working (33% success rate in e2e test)
