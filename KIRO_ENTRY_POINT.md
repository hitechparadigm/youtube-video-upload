6. **⚠️ CURRENT PRIORITY**: Implement comprehensive context awareness for ALL agents (Tasks 12.1-12.7)
7. **NEVER ASK ABOUT API KEYS**: All credentials are in AWS Secrets Manager
8. **DON'T START FROM SCRATCH**: System is operational but needs validation + context enhancement
9. **FOCUS ON DUAL ENHANCEMENT**: 
   - Implement mandatory output validation for ALL agents (Tasks 11.1-11.7)
   - Implement comprehensive context awareness for ALL agents (Tasks 12.1-12.7)
10. **UPDATE DOCUMENTATION**: Always update after any changes
   - Update system status and health percentages
   - Mark completed tasks as ✅ RESOLVED
   - Update deployment timestamps
   - Add verification details for any fixes
   - Update MASTER_SPEC.md with any architectural changes
   - **Document validation enhancements and circuit breaker implementations**

3. **Context Flow**: ✅ WORKING (Agent communication operational but outputs need validation)

**CURRENT PRIORITY (2025-10-07 17:15 UTC):**
- **Critical Issue**: AI agents need industry best practices implementation
- **Specific Issues Identified**:
  - Script Generator: totalDuration calculation fixed, needs industry-standard prompts
  - Media Curator: needs 1-3 assets per scene with proper sequencing for Video Assembler
  - All agents: need comprehensive validation and context awareness
- **Active Work**: Implementing industry best practices for Script Generator and Media Curator
- **Required Actions**:
  1. Implement industry best practices for ALL 6 agents (Tasks 11.1-11.7)
  2. Implement comprehensive context awareness for ALL agents (Tasks 12.1-12.7)
- **Status**: 🔧 ACTIVELY IMPLEMENTING - Industry standards and validation enhancements in progress

3. **Audio Generator AI**: ✅ WORKING - Creating 223s audio files
   - Context-aware narration generation working
   - Amazon Polly integration operational
   - Audio file storage working correctly

4. **Media Curator AI**: ❌ INVESTIGATING - Silent failure detected
   - Returns success but has unhandled function error
   - Context not being stored for Video Assembler
   - Detailed error investigation in progress

5. **Video Assembler**: ⚠️ BLOCKED - Cannot access media context
   - Task 7.2 implementation working correctly
   - Blocked by Media Curator context storage issue
   - Ready to process once media context available

### **📋 DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES**

1. **Always run health check first**: `node scripts/tests/quick-agent-test.js`
2. **Test context flow**: `node scripts/tests/context-flow-test.js`
3. **Update documentation**: When making changes, update this file and SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md
4. **Deploy incrementally**: Test each change before proceeding
5. **Validate with real data**: Use actual Google Sheets and test end-to-end

### **🚫 AVOID THESE MISTAKES**

- ❌ Don't ask about API keys (they're in AWS Secrets Manager)
- ❌ Don't start from scratch (system is 100% working)
- ❌ Don't skip health checks before making changes
- ❌ Don't duplicate existing functionality
- ❌ Don't create excessive .md files (documentation is now consolidated)
- ❌ **NEVER FORGET TO UPDATE KIRO_ENTRY_POINT.md and all respective project documentation** after any changes
