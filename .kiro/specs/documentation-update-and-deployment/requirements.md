# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Following the successful completion of the automated video pipeline with all 6 agents operating at 100% capacity, we need to comprehensively update all project documentation to reflect the current state, achievements, and operational capabilities. This includes updating technical documentation, project status files, architecture guides, and preparing the codebase for GitHub deployment with proper version control practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all documentation files to accurately reflect the current system state and achievements, so that future developers and stakeholders can understand the complete functionality and success metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN all README files SHALL reflect the 6-folder structure and complete pipeline functionality
2. WHEN project status is documented THEN all status files SHALL show 100% operational state with specific metrics
3. WHEN architecture documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include the complete 6-agent workflow with folder structure details
4. WHEN changelog is updated THEN it SHALL include the final completion milestone with success metrics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing the project, I want comprehensive technical documentation that explains the complete system architecture and operational flow, so that I can understand how all components work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technical documentation is reviewed THEN it SHALL include detailed explanations of all 6 agents and their outputs
2. WHEN folder structure is documented THEN it SHALL show the complete videos/{project-id}/ hierarchy with all 6 subfolders
3. WHEN API documentation exists THEN it SHALL reflect all current endpoints and their functionality
4. WHEN deployment guides are updated THEN they SHALL include current AWS infrastructure and cost information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want clear project completion documentation that shows measurable success metrics and operational readiness, so that I can understand the project's value and current capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN success metrics are documented THEN they SHALL include specific performance data (95% quality score, $0.13 cost, etc.)
2. WHEN operational status is reported THEN it SHALL confirm all agents are at 100% functionality
3. WHEN project completion is documented THEN it SHALL include before/after comparisons and achieved milestones
4. WHEN cost analysis is provided THEN it SHALL show detailed AWS cost breakdown and efficiency metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want the codebase properly prepared for GitHub deployment with clean commit history and proper versioning, so that the project can be shared and maintained effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for GitHub push THEN all temporary files and debug scripts SHALL be cleaned up or properly organized
2. WHEN version control is applied THEN commit messages SHALL clearly describe the completion milestone
3. WHEN repository is prepared THEN all sensitive information SHALL be properly handled in environment files
4. WHEN final push is executed THEN the repository SHALL have a clean, professional structure ready for public or team access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a future developer, I want clear setup and usage instructions that reflect the current operational state, so that I can quickly understand how to work with or extend the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setup documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include current dependencies and configuration requirements
2. WHEN usage examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate the complete 6-agent pipeline workflow
3. WHEN troubleshooting guides exist THEN they SHALL address common issues with current system configuration
4. WHEN testing documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the current test suite and validation procedures
