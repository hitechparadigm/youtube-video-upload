# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The YouTube Publishing Completion feature will transform the existing YouTube Publisher from a metadata-only service into a fully functional YouTube upload system. Currently, the YouTube Publisher creates comprehensive metadata files but doesn't actually upload videos to YouTube. This enhancement will add real YouTube API integration with OAuth 2.0 authentication, actual video uploads, and complete publishing workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real YouTube API Integration

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to actually upload my generated videos to YouTube so that they are published and accessible to viewers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video assembly is complete THEN the YouTube Publisher SHALL authenticate with YouTube API v3 using OAuth 2.0
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL upload the actual video file from S3 to YouTube
3. WHEN uploading video THEN the system SHALL use the existing comprehensive metadata (title, description, tags, privacy settings)
4. WHEN upload is complete THEN the system SHALL return the real YouTube video ID and URL
5. WHEN upload fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
6. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically
7. WHEN video is published THEN the system SHALL update the project metadata with actual YouTube URL

### Requirement 2: OAuth 2.0 Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure YouTube authentication so that the system can upload videos on behalf of the configured YouTube channel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up authentication THEN the system SHALL support OAuth 2.0 client credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager
2. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL handle the OAuth flow including authorization codes and access tokens
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh using refresh tokens
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to metadata-only mode
5. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt all tokens and credentials in Secrets Manager
6. WHEN multiple channels are configured THEN the system SHALL support channel selection for uploads

### Requirement 3: Video Upload Processing

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want reliable video uploads with progress tracking so that I know when my videos are successfully published.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading video THEN the system SHALL download the video file from S3 and stream it to YouTube
2. WHEN upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL track upload progress and handle timeouts appropriately
3. WHEN video is large THEN the system SHALL use resumable uploads for files over 100MB
4. WHEN upload completes THEN the system SHALL verify the video is processed and available on YouTube
5. WHEN upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with different strategies
6. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle connection errors gracefully
7. WHEN YouTube API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate rate limiting

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Metadata Integration

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to use all the rich metadata it generates for optimal YouTube SEO and engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading video THEN the system SHALL use the existing comprehensive metadata generation
2. WHEN setting video details THEN the system SHALL apply SEO-optimized titles, descriptions, and tags
3. WHEN video supports chapters THEN the system SHALL add YouTube chapters from the manifest
4. WHEN thumbnails are available THEN the system SHALL upload custom thumbnails from the best scene images
5. WHEN privacy settings are configured THEN the system SHALL respect the specified privacy level (public/unlisted/private)
6. WHEN video category is determined THEN the system SHALL set appropriate YouTube category based on content
7. WHEN upload is complete THEN the system SHALL update all metadata files with actual YouTube information

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Fallback

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling so that the system continues to work even when YouTube uploads fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN YouTube API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to metadata-only mode and continue processing
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL create metadata files and provide instructions for manual upload
3. WHEN upload quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue uploads for retry during off-peak hours
4. WHEN video processing fails on YouTube THEN the system SHALL detect and report processing errors
5. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent retry strategies
6. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors gracefully
7. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable YouTube settings and monitoring so that I can manage the publishing process effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to set default privacy levels, categories, and upload preferences
2. WHEN monitoring uploads THEN the system SHALL track success rates, failure reasons, and performance metrics
3. WHEN uploads are queued THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into pending uploads and processing status
4. WHEN quota limits are approached THEN the system SHALL send alerts and adjust upload scheduling
5. WHEN multiple projects are processed THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent uploads within API limits
6. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and diagnostic information
7. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust upload strategies
