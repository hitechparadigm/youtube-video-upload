# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CI/CD Pipeline Optimization addresses the need to ensure the GitHub Actions pipeline works perfectly by auditing the current setup, cleaning up old pipeline artifacts, and optimizing the workflow for reliability and efficiency. This ensures only necessary components remain and the pipeline operates at peak performance.

## Glossary

- **GitHub_Actions_Pipeline**: The automated CI/CD workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-pipeline.yml`
- **Pipeline_Artifacts**: Build outputs, deployment packages, and workflow run data stored in GitHub
- **Workflow_Runs**: Historical executions of the GitHub Actions pipeline
- **SAM_Template**: The `template-simplified.yaml` file defining infrastructure as code
- **Environment_Configurations**: Dev, staging, and production deployment settings

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pipeline Audit and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to audit and clean up the CI/CD pipeline so that only necessary components remain and the pipeline operates efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing the pipeline THEN the system SHALL identify all existing workflow files and configurations
2. WHEN reviewing workflow runs THEN the system SHALL analyze historical pipeline executions for patterns and issues
3. WHEN cleaning up artifacts THEN the system SHALL remove unnecessary build artifacts and old deployment packages
4. WHEN optimizing storage THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate retention policies for artifacts
5. WHEN validating configurations THEN the system SHALL ensure all environment-specific settings are correct

### Requirement 2: Pipeline Reliability Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that the CI/CD pipeline works reliably so that deployments are consistent and error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the pipeline THEN it SHALL successfully validate syntax and build the application
2. WHEN deploying to environments THEN the pipeline SHALL deploy consistently to dev, staging, and production
3. WHEN running validation tests THEN the pipeline SHALL execute deployment validation successfully
4. WHEN handling failures THEN the pipeline SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the pipeline SHALL complete deployments within acceptable time limits

### Requirement 3: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to ensure the CI/CD pipeline follows security best practices so that deployments are secure and access is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing secrets THEN the pipeline SHALL use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
2. WHEN accessing AWS resources THEN the pipeline SHALL use least-privilege IAM permissions
3. WHEN deploying to environments THEN the pipeline SHALL maintain environment isolation
4. WHEN handling credentials THEN the pipeline SHALL rotate and secure all access keys
5. WHEN auditing access THEN the pipeline SHALL log all deployment activities for compliance

### Requirement 4: Performance and Efficiency Optimization

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to optimize the CI/CD pipeline performance so that deployments are fast and resource-efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building applications THEN the pipeline SHALL use caching to reduce build times
2. WHEN running tests THEN the pipeline SHALL execute only necessary validation steps
3. WHEN deploying changes THEN the pipeline SHALL deploy only when relevant files change
4. WHEN managing resources THEN the pipeline SHALL optimize AWS resource usage and costs
5. WHEN monitoring metrics THEN the pipeline SHALL track and report deployment performance statistics
