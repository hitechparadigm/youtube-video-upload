# Implementation Plan

Convert the codebase cleanup and refactoring design into a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a systematic manner. Prioritize maintaining system health, incremental progress, and comprehensive validation, ensuring no functionality is lost during cleanup. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with a fully consolidated, tested, and deployed system. Focus ONLY on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code.
