# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive codebase cleanup and refactoring of the automated video pipeline system. The system currently has 7 operational AI agents with enhanced Script Generator capabilities, but needs documentation consolidation, code deduplication, comprehensive testing, and streamlined deployment. Based on the MASTER_SPEC, CONTEXT_AWARENESS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY, and current task status, the system is 100% operational but has accumulated technical debt through rapid development iterations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated and current documentation, so that I can understand the system without navigating through obsolete or duplicate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL consolidate MASTER_SPEC.md, CONTEXT_AWARENESS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, SCRIPT_GENERATOR_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md, and TASK_12_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md into a single authoritative source
2. WHEN examining .md files THEN the system SHALL remove obsolete completion summaries and keep only current operational documentation
3. WHEN updating KIRO_ENTRY_POINT.md THEN the system SHALL reflect the current system state without historical completion notes
4. IF duplicate information exists across files THEN the system SHALL merge content and maintain single source of truth

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want refactored Lambda functions with shared utilities, so that the 7 AI agents are maintainable without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL identify common patterns across topic-management, script-generator, media-curator, audio-generator, video-assembler, youtube-publisher, and workflow-orchestrator
2. WHEN analyzing context handling THEN the system SHALL create shared context validation and storage utilities
3. WHEN examining AWS service integrations THEN the system SHALL extract common S3, DynamoDB, and Secrets Manager operations into shared modules
4. IF similar error handling exists THEN the system SHALL create unified error handling and logging utilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consolidated test scripts with comprehensive coverage, so that the system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing test scripts THEN the system SHALL consolidate test-enhanced-script-generator.cjs, test-simple-enhanced.cjs, and other redundant test files
2. WHEN implementing unit tests THEN the system SHALL provide tests for all 7 Lambda functions with at least 80% code coverage
3. WHEN creating integration tests THEN the system SHALL test the complete context flow (Topic → Script → Media → Audio → Video → YouTube)
4. IF critical functionality like enhanced Script Generator exists THEN the system SHALL have corresponding comprehensive test cases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want streamlined deployment with proper version control, so that the enhanced system capabilities are properly tracked and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use CDK to deploy all 7 Lambda functions with Node.js 20.x runtime
2. WHEN updating code THEN the system SHALL validate that enhanced Script Generator with rate limiting is properly deployed
3. WHEN committing changes THEN the system SHALL push consolidated codebase to GitHub with clear commit messages
4. IF deployment validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and maintain system operational status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized Lambda architecture with efficient resource usage, so that the $0.80 per video cost target is maintained while improving performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL maintain the enhanced Script Generator capabilities with professional visual requirements
2. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL ensure rate limiting protection for Bedrock API calls remains functional
3. WHEN reviewing resource allocation THEN the system SHALL optimize Lambda memory and timeout settings based on actual usage patterns
4. IF redundant processing exists THEN the system SHALL eliminate it while preserving the 100% operational status of all 7 agents

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validated system integrity after cleanup, so that the enhanced capabilities and 100% agent health are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing cleanup THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% agent health status (7/7 operational)
2. WHEN validating functionality THEN the system SHALL ensure enhanced Script Generator with professional visual requirements continues working
3. WHEN testing context flow THEN the system SHALL verify Topic → Script → Media → Audio → Video → YouTube pipeline remains operational
4. IF any functionality is impacted THEN the system SHALL restore it before considering cleanup complete
