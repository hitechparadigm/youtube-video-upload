# Pipeline Architecture Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

The current automated video pipeline has architectural redundancy between the Workflow Orchestrator and Async Processor. Both components attempt to handle full pipeline execution, leading to confusion about which component should be used for different scenarios. This specification defines clear roles and optimizes the architecture for better performance and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clear Component Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of concerns between pipeline components, so that I understand which component to use for different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client needs immediate pipeline execution THEN the system SHALL use the Workflow Orchestrator for coordination
2. WHEN a pipeline operation exceeds 25 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically delegate to the Async Processor
3. WHEN a client needs job status tracking THEN the system SHALL provide polling endpoints through the Async Processor
4. IF the Workflow Orchestrator detects a long-running operation THEN it SHALL create an async job and return immediately

### Requirement 2: Optimized Workflow Orchestrator

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Workflow Orchestrator to focus on coordination rather than execution, so that it can handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Workflow Orchestrator receives a pipeline request THEN it SHALL validate inputs and create project context within 5 seconds
2. WHEN agent operations are expected to take longer than 20 seconds THEN the Workflow Orchestrator SHALL delegate to the Async Processor
3. WHEN all agents can complete within 20 seconds THEN the Workflow Orchestrator SHALL execute the pipeline directly
4. WHEN the Workflow Orchestrator delegates to async processing THEN it SHALL return a job ID and status URL immediately

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Async Processor

**User Story:** As a client application, I want reliable async processing with progress tracking, so that I can monitor long-running operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an async job is created THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion time and progress updates
2. WHEN processing individual agents THEN the system SHALL update job progress at each step
3. WHEN an async job completes THEN the system SHALL store results in the standardized S3 structure
4. WHEN a client polls for job status THEN the system SHALL return current progress, estimated time remaining, and any errors

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Operation Routing

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the system to automatically choose the best execution method, so that I don't need to understand internal architecture details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is received THEN the system SHALL analyze operation complexity and choose sync or async execution
2. WHEN sync execution is chosen THEN the response SHALL include complete results within 25 seconds
3. WHEN async execution is chosen THEN the response SHALL include job ID and polling information within 2 seconds
4. WHEN operation routing fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to async processing with appropriate error handling

### Requirement 5: Unified API Interface

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a single API endpoint that handles both sync and async operations transparently, so that I can build consistent user interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling the pipeline API THEN the system SHALL accept a preference parameter for sync/async execution
2. WHEN no preference is specified THEN the system SHALL automatically choose the optimal execution method
3. WHEN sync execution is not possible THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to async with client notification
4. WHEN the API response format differs between sync/async THEN the system SHALL provide clear indicators of the execution type

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want optimized resource usage and faster execution times, so that the pipeline can handle higher throughput efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents can run in parallel THEN the system SHALL execute them concurrently
2. WHEN agent dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL respect the execution order while maximizing parallelism
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL queue operations and provide estimated wait times
4. WHEN operations complete faster than expected THEN the system SHALL update time estimates for future operations
