4. WHEN video assembly is complete THEN the system SHALL validate video quality using Amazon Rekognition
5. WHEN processing video THEN the system SHALL ensure final duration is between 5-10 minutes
6. IF video processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative media assets

### Requirement 6: YouTube Publishing and SEO

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to automatically upload videos to YouTube with optimal SEO so that my content reaches the maximum audience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN publishing video THEN the system SHALL apply generated SEO metadata during upload
4. WHEN upload is complete THEN the system SHALL log video URL and status to DynamoDB for tracking
5. IF YouTube upload fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff

### Requirement 7: Scheduling and Automation

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to schedule video creation and publishing so that I have consistent content output without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria
