# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for implementing an FFmpeg Lambda layer to enable real video processing capabilities in the automated video pipeline. Currently, the Video Assembler uses a fallback system that creates instruction files instead of actual MP4 videos due to missing FFmpeg binaries in the Lambda runtime environment. This feature will provide the Video Assembler with the necessary FFmpeg and ffprobe binaries to create real video files, transforming the pipeline from instruction-based to actual video production.

## Glossary

- **FFmpeg**: A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video
- **Lambda Layer**: AWS Lambda deployment package that contains libraries, custom runtimes, or other function dependencies
- **Video Assembler**: The 6th component in the AI pipeline responsible for combining images and audio into video files
- **Fallback System**: Current mechanism that creates video instruction files when FFmpeg is unavailable
- **Pipeline**: The complete 7-component automated video creation system
- **SAM Template**: AWS Serverless Application Model template for infrastructure deployment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a video pipeline operator, I want the Video Assembler to create real MP4 video files instead of instruction files, so that the pipeline produces actual videos ready for YouTube publishing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Video Assembler function executes, THE Lambda Layer SHALL provide FFmpeg and ffprobe binaries at `/opt/bin/ffmpeg` and `/opt/bin/ffprobe`
2. WHEN FFmpeg binaries are available, THE Video Assembler SHALL create actual MP4 video files instead of fallback instruction files
3. WHEN video processing completes successfully, THE Video Assembler SHALL upload the MP4 file to the designated S3 bucket location
4. WHERE FFmpeg binaries are unavailable, THE Video Assembler SHALL continue using the existing fallback system
5. WHILE video processing is active, THE Lambda function SHALL have sufficient memory and timeout allocation for video creation operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the FFmpeg layer to be deployed through Infrastructure as Code, so that deployments are consistent and reproducible across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SAM Template SHALL define an FFmpeg Lambda layer resource with proper configuration
2. THE SAM Template SHALL reference the FFmpeg layer in the Video Assembler function configuration
3. WHEN deploying the infrastructure, THE SAM deployment SHALL create the layer and associate it with the Video Assembler function
4. THE Layer Configuration SHALL specify nodejs22.x as a compatible runtime
5. THE Layer Deployment SHALL include all necessary FFmpeg dependencies and libraries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the FFmpeg layer to be built from a reliable source with proper versioning, so that video processing capabilities are stable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE FFmpeg Layer SHALL be built using a documented and reproducible build process
2. THE Layer Build Process SHALL use a specific FFmpeg version for consistency across deployments
3. THE Layer Package SHALL include both FFmpeg and ffprobe binaries with all required dependencies
4. THE Build Script SHALL validate binary functionality before packaging the layer
5. THE Layer Versioning SHALL follow semantic versioning for tracking and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a video pipeline developer, I want the Video Assembler to automatically detect FFmpeg availability and choose the appropriate processing mode, so that the system gracefully handles both scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Video Assembler starts, THE function SHALL check for FFmpeg binary availability at the expected paths
2. IF FFmpeg binaries are available, THEN THE Video Assembler SHALL use real video processing mode
3. IF FFmpeg binaries are unavailable, THEN THE Video Assembler SHALL use the existing fallback instruction mode
4. THE Video Assembler SHALL log the processing mode selection for debugging and monitoring purposes
5. THE Processing Mode Selection SHALL not cause function failures regardless of FFmpeg availability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the Video Assembler with FFmpeg to have appropriate resource allocation, so that video processing completes within acceptable time limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Video Assembler Function SHALL have a timeout of at least 900 seconds for video processing operations
2. THE Video Assembler Function SHALL have memory allocation of at least 3008 MB for video processing operations
3. WHEN processing videos up to 5 minutes duration, THE Video Assembler SHALL complete within the allocated timeout
4. THE Function Configuration SHALL be optimized for video processing workloads
5. THE Resource Allocation SHALL be documented with rationale for the chosen limits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing of the FFmpeg layer functionality, so that video processing reliability is validated before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Testing Suite SHALL include unit tests for FFmpeg binary detection and validation
2. THE Testing Suite SHALL include integration tests for complete video assembly with real FFmpeg processing
3. THE Testing Suite SHALL validate video output quality and format compliance
4. WHEN FFmpeg layer is deployed, THE tests SHALL verify both real processing and fallback modes work correctly
5. THE Test Results SHALL demonstrate successful video creation with proper audio synchronization and visual quality
