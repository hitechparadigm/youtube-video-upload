## 📅 **AUTOMATIC SCHEDULING SYSTEM**

### **EventBridge Rules Deployed:**
1. **Regular Schedule**: `automated-video-pipeline-auto-schedule`
   - Frequency: Every 8 hours
   - Status: ✅ ACTIVE
   - Target: Workflow Orchestrator

2. **High Priority Schedule**: `automated-video-pipeline-high-priority-schedule`
   - Frequency: Every 4 hours
   - Status: ⚠️ DISABLED (can be enabled in AWS Console)
   - Target: Workflow Orchestrator

### **How Automatic Scheduling Works:**

```
⏰ EventBridge Timer (Every 8 hours)
    ↓
🎯 Workflow Orchestrator (receives scheduled event)
    ↓
📋 Topic Management AI (reads Google Sheets)
    ↓
📝 Script Generator AI (creates script)
    ↓
🎨 Media Curator AI + 🎵 Audio Generator AI (parallel)
    ↓
🎬 Video Assembler AI (combines everything)
    ↓
📺 YouTube Publisher AI (publishes with SEO)
    ↓
✅ Video Live on YouTube!
```

### **Google Sheets Configuration:**
Your spreadsheet should have this structure:
```
| Topic                          | Daily Frequency | Last Used  | Priority |
|--------------------------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| AI Tools for Content Creation | 2              | 2025-01-07 | High     |
| Investment Apps Review         | 1              | 2025-01-06 | Medium   |
| Productivity Hacks             | 3              | 2025-01-05 | High     |
```

**Scheduling Logic:**
- System checks frequency limits before creating videos
- High-priority topics processed first
- Last used dates prevent immediate repetition
- Frequency settings control daily video limits
